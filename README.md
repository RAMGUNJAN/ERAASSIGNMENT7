.........................................................................
MODEL 1st : Reduced the parameter up to 6000
Targets: Parameters should be less than 8000
Results: Train Accuracy : 98.14% , Test Accuracy : 98.26%
Analysis: Model is good ..Required to increase the accuracy


...............................................................................
